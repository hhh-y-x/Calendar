# Calendar Project

This project is a **calendar** that displays the current date and provides the functionality to navigate through months and years. Users can switch between months and years using buttons and input fields in the header. The local time is displayed in the footer.

## Features

- **Navigation Buttons**: Four buttons to navigate to the next/previous month and year.
- **Month and Year Selection**: Allows users to select the month and year from input fields.
- **Current Date Display**: Shows the current date in the calendar.
- **Local Time**: Displays the current local time in the footer.

## BEM Methodology

This project follows the **BEM (Block Element Modifier)** methodology for structuring the HTML and CSS. BEM helps create a modular and reusable structure by clearly defining components and their variations.

## SVG Icons Used

The following SVG icons were used in this project:

- [SVG from svgrepo](https://www.svgrepo.com/svg/257626/down-arrow?edit=true)
- [SVG from svgrepo](https://www.svgrepo.com/svg/257662/left-arrow-next)

These icons were used to represent navigation actions, such as moving between months and years.


## Future Enhancements

- **Dynamic Calendar Rendering**: Implement logic to dynamically render the calendar based on the selected month and year.
- **Improved Navigation**: Enhance the navigation buttons to allow for smoother month and year transitions.
- **Responsive Design**: Implement responsive design to ensure the calendar works well on different screen sizes.
- **Time Zone Support**: Add support for different time zones in the footer time display.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** for the structure of the calendar.
- **CSS3** for styling, following the BEM methodology.
- **JavaScript** for the logic behind month and year selection and local time display.
